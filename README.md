### Nice to meet you!  
I'm a postgraduate student looking to forge a path in data science, starting with my MSc. As with any beginner, I'm still very much feeling my way around the space and learning as much as I can. ðŸ“–

I'm particularly interested in data analytics and modelling. I love diving into the nitty gritty details of a messy dataset and digging up interesting insights that may be invisible to (or ignored by) others. Recently, I have started to delve into the wonderful, complex field of NLP and am really excited by what lies ahead! ðŸ˜Ž 

This portfolio serves as a documentation of my data science learning journey, and will mainly comprise data science-related projects that I've worked on - from hackathons to academic coursework. I have also started on a personal project (for fun!) and will showcase it here once it's done. ðŸ’¯

## Rapid fire  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my master's in data science at King's College London, and will be beginning my internship as Commerce Data Science intern at TikTok soon! Exciting times ahead
  

- ðŸ’¡ Recent projects: [expense-tracker-tele-bot](https://github.com/crong12/expense-tracker-tele-bot) | [image-segmentation-sffcm](https://github.com/crong12/image-segmentation-sffcm) 
  

- âš¡ Fun fact: While I use dark themes to code in Python like everyone else, I actually prefer coding in R in the default light theme!
